Proposal:

Title: Know your Tools: Using Neovim for Python Development

It is extremely important to know and constantly be learning about the tools you use everyday as a developer. In this talk I will share about the cool features and workflows of the neovim editor I have learned over the year used to develop python projects. The talk will begin with some general tips and insights I have learned during the pandemic such as the importance of learning to touch type, customizing my keyboard layout, and to always be learning and appyling the skills you have learned. Next I will cover many of the tools and tips I have learned while using the neovim editor with a focus on python.

Topics to cover:
- Touch typing and customizing a 40% ortholinear keyboard
- Some cool python books I have read over the year as an example to further your knowledge
- Using Language Server Protocol to perform completions, formatting, definitions
- Using tree-sitter to highlight code and code analysis
- Fuzzy Finding with telescope plugin to find files and search your code
- commands/plugins  to build and test your program

Talk Objective:
The talk objective would be to tell the development community my experiences of the importance of knowing your tools. Striving to get 1% better everyday and to always be learning. Secondarily to show the power of the neovim for python programming and telling the community of workflows and plugins that will help them.
